## 📌 What is EXIF?

EXIF *(Exchangeable Image File Format)* is hidden metadata baked into every image file.
It records things like camera model, GPS coordinates, date taken, lens settings, ISO, and more.
Every photo you shoot with a phone or camera has it — most people never see it.

**File Data Editor** lets you see all of it, and change any of it.

## ⚡ Quick Start

> ### 🏆 Recommendation — Use the Web Version
> 
> Open `medit-site/medit.html` in your browser. That's it.
> No Python, no install, no terminal. Works on any device with a browser.
> The CLI is a bonus for power users and batch automation.
